## Purpose

Assignment 2 project for Further Programming and Algorithms module, year 2020/21.

## Requirements

* [C++](https://www.cplusplus.com/) 17 or higher
* [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) 1.75 or higher

## How to play

A category of questions will be selected at random. You will be asked 5 questions from that category. The question will be presented in alpha-numeric code (1=A, 2=B, 3=C, etc.). You will need to guess the correct answer using this code. For example if the answer is Arsenal, the question will be presented as:

1 18 19 5 14 1 12

You will be given a score out of 5 at the end, and an opportunity to play again.

**NOTE:** Answers are not case sensitive.

**Easy Mode**

During Quick Play, if you've played that particular category before and have an overall score of less than 50% in that category, you'll be offered an easy mode. When playing on easy mode all of the vowels in the questions will be visible. Score is not affected.
